# Dashboard

Dash was used to visualize our findings and the functional dashboard is deployed and available here on [Heroku](https://pandas-flight-dashboard.herokuapp.com/). 

A quick video of the dashboard is also available for download [here](https://github.com/Pandas-UFT/Pandas/blob/master/dashboard/dashboard.mp4) on github.

A preview of our dashboard is displayed below.
